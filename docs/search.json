    "text": "Technology and Other Resources\nSome of the work we will do in this class will require the use of technology such as a graphing calculators or dynamic graphing software such as Desmos. I highly recommend that you create a (free) Desmos account so that you can save your work. If you have questions about how to use any of these tools, please let me know. If you do use technology in your work, please indicate this in your written solutions.\n\nA word on search engines\nSearch engines (Google, DuckDuckGo, etc) use algorithms to determine what content on the internet is likely to be relevant to your search query. They can be useful for finding references, explanations, solutions, etc. They cannot find information that is not on the internet, and search results may be affected by hidden parameters introduced by the companies that run them. Whether this content actually is relevant (or correct) is up to you to figure out.\n\n\nA word on videos\nStudents sometimes seek out video explanations of concepts and techniques covered in this course. While I don’t object to getting help this way, you should be aware that these explanations may very well use notation, definitions, or ideas that are not convered in this class, sometimes for very intentional reasons!\n\n\nA word on GenAI\nAI text generators (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) use Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce text that is likely to resemble a human-produced response to a given prompt. They are most likely to produce a meaningful output on topics where a great deal of human-produced text has already been written – which happens to include most of undergraduate mathematics. This output, however, is based on statistical predictions from contextual clues, not logical deductions or expert knowledge and there’s no guarantee that it’s mathematically correct!\nMy general feeling about the use of AI tools in the context of this course is that they fundamentally get in the way of your learning in several ways and should not be used in any capacity.\n\nThey are prone to both plagiarizing as well as making things up. Since their responses are produced from an amalgamation of many sources (sometimes without the permission of the original authors) they invariably use definitions, notation, assumptions, and concepts that we have not introduced in our class.\nAI tools undermine the collaborative learning community that we would like to develop. A significant way in which we will be building understanding in the class is through discussion with each other.\nUsing AI tools means that you are cheating yourself out of an opportunity to learn. The whole point of being in this class is to learn how to use certain ideas and tools to solve problems. Note that I didn’t say that the point is to solve problems. This is a very much like the difference between taking your car to a mechanic vs. learning how to fix it yourself. Or going to a restaurant vs. learning how to cook.\nUsing AI tools undermines the relationship between student and instructor. When a student gives me work that seems AI generated, it creates an adversarial dynamic and now I’m looking at everything that student gives me with suspicion. If you ever feel tempted to use AI tools to shortcut your learning, please pause and come talk to me about finding a different strategy.\nApart from doing mathematics, students sometimes use AI tools to help with writing (and here I’m also thinking of tools like Grammerly). Here’s a secret – AI-assisted writing is bad writing, period. It might be gramatically “correct” but that’s not the same thing as good writing. Good writing involves actual thinking by a unique individual person.\n\nSo where does that leave us? I really do not want to lay down a policy of “THOU SHALL NOT…” because I’d much rather simply trust you. So that’s what I’ll do - you now know how I feel about using AI tools in this class and I will trust that you will respect me, your classmates, and our goals for being here together enough that you’ll honor that trust.",

In class, we will often work in small groups on activities designed to engage and practice working with the course content. Outside of class, you will have assignments to practice what we’ve learned and to stretch your problem solving skills. You will also be asked to reflect on your learning – mathematics is as much about the problem solving process as it is about finding a correct answer and so reflecting and writing about your work is an important part of what we’ll do.\nSince we will be doing much of our learning through collaborative in-class activities, it’s important that you to come to class prepared to engage and participate. That said, I also recognize that for many reasons, this will not always be possible. If you need to miss class just let me know – there is no penalty apart from missing out on that day’s activity. If you miss class often, you can expect me to reach out to see how I can support you coming to class.\nPoem 013: Did I Miss Anything? by Tom Wyman\nI will do my best to post on Moodle a short summary of what we do in class, so if you do miss class, you should look there to see what we did that day.

    "text": "5.2 Weekly Homework\nMost weeks I will assign several problems that give you a chance to engage with and practice using the concepts introduced in class. Completing these problems will help you work toward gaining proficiency in the course learning targets.\nSome homework problems may feel straightforward and similiar to work done in class, while others are meant to challenge you. This means that you might not see how to begin a problem right away. This is intentional! If, after thinking about a problem for day or so, you’re still stuck, let me know and I can give you suggestions.\nHomework is also an opportunity to practice effective communication of your understanding. Your goal when writing up a solution is not just to find an answer, but to convince your reader that your solution is reasonable. As such, you should strive to write clearly, legibly, and (whenever appropriate) in complete sentences. If your reader can’t follow your reasoning, or read your writing, then you have not achieved this goal. See the section on Writing Mathematics for more hints about how to write mathematics effectively.\n\n5.2.1 Homework Reports\nHomework is a place to be challenged, make mistakes, struggle productively, and learn how to proceed in the face of uncertainty. Overall, the benefit of homework lies as much in the process as it does in producing a correct answer. For this reason, weekly homework will not be graded in the traditional sense. Instead of handing in solutions to all of the homework problems, we will discuss solutions in class and you will submit a homework report which should include:\n\na list of problems that you attempted and completed\na short description of the questions that came up for you while you worked on the homework\nIf you have solution that you would like feedback on, you may include that with your report (limit one per week).

AEP assignments will also typically require more extensive writing to clearly communicate your work.\nAEP assignments will generally be due two weeks from when they are assigned. After getting feedback on your assignment, if you would like to revise and resubmit you may do so within one week. Revisions should be written up separately - do not simply squeeze corrections into the margin of your original paper. You should also include a short summary of your revisions, i.e. tell me what you’ve done to address my feedback or any other changes that you made.

For these reasons, you can (almost) always request an extension – just send me an email. Note that if you ask for lots of extensions, you can expect that I will reach out to see if we can work together to find ways for you to keep up with the work in the course.\nThat said, there are reasons for having due dates. For one thing, they help you organize your life by helping you know how to budget your time. For another, they help me organize my life – in particular, they help me keep up on getting your work back to you. If you hand in work after the due date, I cannot guarantee that I will get it back to you with useful feedback.\n\nHard Deadlines\nTo prevent work from backing up, there are two hard deadlines in this course - one is February 28th (the Friday before spring break) and the other is May 2nd (the last day of classes).

We will have regular short in-class check-ins (roughly one per week) throughout the semester which are opportunities for you to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of these topics. A list of these topics can be found in Section 4.1, and is also posted on Moodle.\nTypically, each check-in will have a few problems that cover the Learning Targets that we’ve covered most recently. Each learning target will appear on an in-class check-in at least twice.\nYour progress on each Learning Target will be described in one of the following ways:\n\nProficient: You have demonstrated good understanding of this topic without any errors.\nMinor Revisions Needed: You have demonstrated a fairly complete understanding of this learning target but your work contains either minor errors or a small gap in your explanation.\nTo change this to Proficient you should submit a revised solution, along with a short description of what the error/gap was and how you corrected it. Write your revision on a new piece of paper and staple that on top of your original submission. This revision must be submitted within one week.\nNot Yet Proficient: Partial understanding is evident, but gaps still remain indicating that further study is needed.\nIncomplete: Fragmentary response provided; or solution is attempted using inappropriate methodology.\n\n\n5.5.1 Re-assessments\nEach content learning target will appear on at least two in-class check-ins, so if you aren’t able to demonstrate proficiency the first time it appears, you will have another chance to re-assess on another week. In addition to our weekly check-ins, there are a few other ways that you can demonstrate proficiency:\n\nYou may do a re-assessment during drop-in hours - note that during drop-in hours, I will prioritize students who are there with questions. You should let me know in advance which Learning Target you want to re-assess (so that I’m prepared) and you must bring a re-assessment ticket with you (see below).\nYou may schedule a re-assessment using my Calendly link.\nThere will be one mid-semester check-in and one final check-in which will include all learning targets covered up to that point.\n\nFinally, please note the following restrictions on re-assessing:\n\nYou may not attempt more than two (2) re-assessments outside of class for a particular learning target. This does not include the mid-semester or final check-in.\nYou may not attempt to re-assess more than one learning target at a time. Exceptions to this may be made in certain cases where Learning Targets are closely aligned.\nNo re-assessments, other than the final check-in, will be given during finals week.\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Re-assessment Ticket\nIf you are reassessing a learning target outside of class, you must submit written responses, on a separate piece of paper, to the following questions at the time of your reassessment:\n\nWhat were your mistakes/gaps/sticking points on your previous attempt?\nWhat steps did you take to improve your understanding? Did you re-do the problem? List any resources you used to study and prepare for this attempt.",

    "text": "6.3 Grade Guidelines\nIn thinking about course grades, I find it helpful to begin with qualitative descriptions of what particular grades might signify. We can then think about ways you might demonstrate learning that aligns with these descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\nThis grade generally indicates a deep understanding of the material such that you could apply the material in unfamiliar or especially complex situations. Evidence of deep understanding might include\n\n\n\ndemonstration of proficiency on all of the content learning targets at least twice.\ncompletion of all AEPs in terms of both mathematical content as well as effective communication\n\nYou also have demonstrated significant engagement of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\nThis grade indicates good work that is eminently satisfactory. You should be able to use and extend this knowledge in many situations although you might have difficulty with particularly challenging or unfamiliar problems. Evidence of this learning might include\n\n\n\ndemonstration of proficiency on most of the learning targets at least twice\ncompletion of most of the AEPs including both mathematical content as well as effective communication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\n\nThis grade indicates competent work that demonstrates a basic understanding of the course material. You should be able to handle most of the more straightforward problems encountered but might struggle with more challenging problems. Evidence of a C might include:\n\n\n\nProficiency on some of the learning targets at least twice\nCompletion of some the AEPs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD/F\n\nThese grades represent a fundamental breakdown of expectations. A D represents a meaningful but unsuccessful attempt at earning a C or above. An F represents such a severe lack of engagement, effort, or understanding that there is no evidence of meaningful progress.",

    "text": "6.4 Engagement\nWhile your course grade should be based primarily on your understanding of course content and not on course engagement, in my experience these typically go hand in hand. So while engagement in the course is not itself evidence of understanding, it does usually help us achieve that goal.\nHere are some ways that you can engage with the class:\n\nAttend class regularly\nComplete assigned problems before class so you’re prepared to engage with that day’s material\nAsk questions - either in class or in office hours.\nActively participate in class discussions and group work. Note that this can mean sharing your work but it can also mean asking questions or helping to facilitate the discussion.\nComplete weekly homework reports\nComplete periodic check-ins\nComplete homework and AEPs on time – and asking for help when needed\n\nA modifier to your grade to acccount for engagement.\n\nA + modifier might be added to your grade if you’ve met the standards for a particular grade and you’ve engaged in the course in particularly significant ways.\nA - modifier might be added to your grade if you’ve met the standard for a particular grade but lack of engagement has prevented your from doing more in the course.\n\nYour goal is to demonstrate proficiency on most of the learning targets – this is accomplished by demonstrating proficient level understanding by the end of the semester. I will keep track (and I encourage you to keep track as well) every time you demonstrate Proficient level work.\nA grade modifier may be added to your base grade as follows.\nA may be added to the base grade if all but one of the guidelines for the base grade are met significant progress towards completion is evident (e.g. proficiency has been demonstrated only once instead of twice).\nA will be added to the base grade if all requirements for the base grade are met two of three meet the requirements for a higher grade.",

If your handwriting is not up to the task, you might consider using a typesetting enviornment such as LaTeX or Typst. I can help you get started with these tools.\nInclude your name, the date, the class and section number, and the name of the assignment.\nProblems should be clearly labeled and numbered on the left side of the paper. Leave a visible separation between problems. Write the problems in order.\nBegin your solution with the original problem statement (or a paraphrasing of such). Do not assume that your reader has the problem statement in front of them.\nUse whitespace on the margins and between problems to make your solutions easier to read. Leave room in the margins for comments.\nIf you worked with other students on a problem, acknowledge their contributions.\nIf you used technology on a problem, acknowledge where and how.\nAssignments submitted electronically should be submitted as a single PDF file. If scanned, make sure your images are clear and not cropped. Take care that pages are in the correct order and are rotated to the proper orientation. File names should include some identifying information such as your last name and what assignment this is (imagine this file in a folder with submissions from other students).",

    "text": "8.1 Academic Integrity\nThe University of Portland is a diverse academic community of learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.\nEspecially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at libguides.up.edu/cite.\nThe misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work, upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.",
