My main goal as the professor in this course is to help you succeed, not just in learning the material but in growing as a learner.  Learning takes effort, a willingness to try something that may not work, and an openness to learning from feedback.; my job is to create an environment in which all of you are supported in these aspects.\n",

I want you to feel comfortable coming to me with any questions or concerns that arise, mathematical and otherwise.   If you encounter any issues that interfere with your learning, whether they are physical, mental, emotional, economic, or otherwise, or if you experience discrimination or mistreatment of any sort, please contact me immediately.  Other resources for support include the Chair of the Math Department or the CAS Dean of Students.\n",
