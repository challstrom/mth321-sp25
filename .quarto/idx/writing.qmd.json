Your reader should be convinced that your solution is correct without having to fill in any missing steps.\n\n-   Respect your reader. This means that your solution should clear, easy to read, and free of spelling and grammatical errors, even if the mathematical steps are correct.

Do not assume that your reader has the problem statement in front of them.\n\n-   Use whitespace on the margins and between problems to make your solutions easier to read.
