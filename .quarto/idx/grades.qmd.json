Worse than that, research suggests that grades undermine the learning process in several ways:\n\n-   Grades tend to diminish interest in what you're learning.\n-   Grades create a preference for the easiest task. In other words, students tend to do what they need to get a certain grade, but no more.\n-   Grades tend to reduce the quality of student thinking. The moment we ask \\`\\`**how** am I doing?'' we lose track of **what** we're doing.\n\nWhile I am required to submit a grade for each student at the end of the semester -- I will do what I can to de-emphasize the role of grades in this course so that as much as possible our focus is on learning. \n\n\nWe will rely extensively on qualitative rather than quantitative feedback to assess your progress in the course.  Your understanding of the material will be assessed primarily through demonstrating proficiency on the learning targets listed in @sec-targets.\n\nAlthough the posted learning targets point to fairly specific topics, there are still a wide array of problems that might demonstrate proficiency.  For this reason, you should aim to demonstrate proficiency **at least twice** on each target by the end of the semester.  I will keep track (and I encourage you to keep track as well) every time to demonstrate proficient work.\n\n## Engagement\n\nAlthough your course grade will be based primarily on your **understanding** of course content and not on course engagement, in my experience these typically go hand in hand. So while engagement in the course is not itself evidence of understanding, it does usually help us achieve that goal.\n\nHere are some ways that you can engage with the class:\n\n-   Attend class regularly\n-   Complete assigned problems before class so you're prepared to engage with that day's material\n-   Contribute to in-class group work\n-   Complete weekly homework reports\n-   Complete periodic check-ins\n-   Come to drop-in hours to ask questions\n-   Complete homework and AEPs on time -- and asking for help when needed\n\n## Grade Guidelines\n\nIn thinking about course grades, I find it helpful to begin with *qualitative* descriptions of what particular grades might signify.
